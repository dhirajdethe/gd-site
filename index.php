                <span class="weight-700">I am Girish</span>, an inter-disciplinary faculty of Design at the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/" class="link" target="_blank" >Industrial Design Centre (IDC),
                    IIT Bombay</a>. I teach subjects in the area of Visual Design, Interaction Design and Design research.<br/><br/>

                My research interests in the domain of Visual design are: Devanagari Typography (History,
                Type design methodologies, Theoretical Modeling, Classification, and Type-Culture); within the field
                of Interaction design my research interests are: Culture sensitive Interactions, Frugal Computing,
                search-retrieval paradigms, Indian Language (localized) interfaces and input mechanisms for Indic scripts.
                As a design researcher my work deals with applying Statistical and Mathematical modeling techniques for designers.<br/><br/>

                I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, a Master’s degree in Design and a Ph.D. from IIT Bombay.
                My doctoral research dealt with the theoretical modeling of Devanagari typefaces.
                As a type designer I have co-created several typefaces for Indian scripts, prominent amongst these is the <a href="https://ektype.in/" class="link" target="_blank">Ek multi-script family</a>, the open source Ek Mukta family ,
                LifeOk Devanagari and Star Bengali.<br/><br/>
